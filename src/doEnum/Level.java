public enum Level {
//An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).
//To create an enum, use the enum keyword (instead of class or interface), and separate the constants with a comma.
// Note that they should be in uppercase letters:
// Enum declaration can be done outside a class or inside a class but not inside a method
  // we can assign value without declare a variable. ex: high, medium, low are values
    HIGH,MEDIUM,LOW
